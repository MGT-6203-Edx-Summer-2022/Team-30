 Stroke Prediction
 
 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. In this project, the “ Stroke Prediction Dataset” is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient. The project is delivered following the below five main sections:
 
●	Data Exploration and Analysis 
●	Classification and prediction using Support Vector Machine
●	Classification and prediction using Logistic Regression
●	Classification and prediction using Random Forest
●	Classification and prediction using K-Nearest Neighbor

The objective questions that are aimed to be answered at the end of this project are: 

1.	Which predictor variables are most correlated with the rate of stroke? 
2.	Will marriage increase the risk of getting a stroke?
3.	Does stroke have a strong correlation with other health indicator factors (such as smoking?)
The business justifications for the project are as follows:
The outcome of our analysis is expected to indicate that stroke is correlated with the health status of individuals, and the following markets will be impacted: 
1.	Health Insurance: Increasing the insurance premium for individuals with a high probability of stroke. 
2.	Advertisement: Strategy changes in targeting the individuals by the various markets such as health care providers, dietary supplement industry, etc. 
3.	Medical institutions: Improving more routine care for individuals who have a high chance of stroke and are susceptible
